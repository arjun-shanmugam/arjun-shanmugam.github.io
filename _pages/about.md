I am a Predoctoral Fellow at [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org). At Opportunity Insights, I have worked on projects studying the role of [colleges](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/24/upshot/ivy-league-elite-college-admissions.html) as engines of upward mobility. I also rebuilt the IRS Databank, a database used by the Treasury and the IRS that manipulates the universe of raw American tax records into a person-year panel structure. 

I graduated from Brown in May 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science-Economics. At Brown, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Emily Oster](https://emilyoster.net) and won the Department of Economics' award for the best senior thesis in my graduating class.
